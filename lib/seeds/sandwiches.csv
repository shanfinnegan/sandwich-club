I always get a little confused about the nature  of ""white sauce"" when I am ordering (is it tahini or mayo?) and often my falafel ends up a little heavy on the mayo.  Another funny thing:  I have probably bought a sandwich from the man at this food truck 8-10 times and this time he told me I have a British accent.  Doesn't make sense."

Perfect combo of sweet and savory. the textures meld perfectly and the arugula adds a fresh and spicy kick. They should put it up on the board, its just that good. Order it and you won't be disappointed. Better yet, share it with a friend and split an unforgettable ice cream sandwich for dessert! I have tried many combinations including adding mustard, adding sun dried tomatoes, trying a hard cheese in addition to the brie, all of these were also delicious but i like the aforementioned ingredient combo the best.

I recommend this deli if you are into the mayo-based salamiches. They have many options. I hadn't willingly eaten mayonnaise in 20 years when this egg salad called out to me. It was amazing, and I've had at least 2 of these salamiches per week for the last 3 months. "
