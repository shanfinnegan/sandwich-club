"UPDATE: they took them off the menu, health code violation (must be stored at sub-38 degree environments? lame. germs don't exist)",15,6
are there no condiments at all/?! i suggest adding lemon juice or mustard or tomato or something,17,
Lemon &/or hot pepper is a nice addition,17,
"What! This sounds so crazy, i cant wait to try",20,10
Myla this is hilarious.  Especially because you ate it at work,21,1
this sounds like a really zesty delish/incredibly innovative vegetarian sandwich (known for their lameness)!,22,6

bierkraft has my favorite sandwiches ever!! I'm sad you haven't had a good experience. I have been there too many times to try to recount the past experiences but I'll make a note the next time i go.,42,13
"I think I need to get into the ""build your own"" option.  What do you usually order, Claire?",42,1

Can we talk about other butters?  Is cashew butter something I should be getting into?  Pistachio butter?,43,1

canned salmon is a goldmine of secret delish sandwiches,77,6
Had to add some sugar to the chutney to make it play nice with the sandwich meat.  Worked kind of like a cranberry sauce. Next time I'd use butter rather than mayo.,78,
"hot sauce is a nice addition, i tried it the other day and will add it to my ordering repetoire",82,31
I cannot wait to try this,86,1
"Bierkraft is amazing.  I've been going there since they opening and it's absolutely delightful that you can drink a pint of cask beer and eat chocolate, cheese, and sandwiches generally unbothered for most of the afternoon.",86,3

"see aliya's entry, #49 for my version of ""the Breanne""",87,
